Many executable application codes are much smaller than the web-scale datasets they process, 
and cloud computing avoids large data movement during execution.. 
The core of a cloud is the server cluster (or VM cluster). 
The cluster nodes are used as compute nodes. 
A few control nodes are used to manage and monitor of the cloud activities. 
The scheduling of user jobs on a cloud is required to assign the work to virtual clusters created for users. 
The gateway nodes provide the access points of the service from the outside world. 
These gateway nodes can be also used for security control of the entire cloud platform.
In physical clusters, users expect static demand of resources. 
Clouds are designed to face fluctuating workloads and thus demand variable amounts of resource dynamically. 
Datacenters and supercomputers do have some similarities and distinctions. For datacenters, the scaling is a fundamental requirement. 
The datacenter server clusters are built with low-cost servers. 
For example, Microsoft has a datacenter in the Chicago area with 100,000 8-core servers housed in 50 containers. 
In a supercomputer, a separate storage disk array is used, while a datacenter uses local disks attached to server nodes.
The cloud offers significant benefit to IT companies by freeing them from the low level task of setting up the hardware (servers) 
and managing the system software tools. 
Cloud computing applies a virtual platform with elastic resources put together by on-demand provisioning of hardware, software and data. 
The cloud enables moving desktop computing to a service-oriented platform using server clusters and huge databases. 
Cloud computing leverages its low cost and simplicity to both providers and users.
